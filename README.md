# Game Project

A casual 2D exploration game with potential releases on mobile and Steam.

## Project Status

🚧 **Early Planning Phase** - Concept development and structure setup

## Current Direction

**Concept:** Fantasy Exploration Simulator

**Core Concept:**
- **Genre:** Casual Exploration / Walking Simulator
- **Gameplay:** Side-scrolling exploration - aimless wandering through handcrafted fantasy landscapes
- **Character:** Relatable magical being (wizard or elf) - human-like, not too fantastical
- **Movement:** Walking primarily (side-scrolling), flying may come as discovery later
- **World:** Handcrafted, small to start (1-2 environments), expandable
- **Art Style:** Detailed pixel art - beautiful and polished
- **Collection:** Simple item gathering - no complex menus or nested structures
- **Playtime:** Flexible - enjoyable for 5 minutes or 5 hours
- **Experience:** Peaceful, aimless exploration with simple item collection - no quests, no pressure

## Getting Started

1. **Quick Context:** Read [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md) for a concise overview of the game concept
2. Review [PROJECT_PLAN.md](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) for the overall development roadmap
3. Fill out [docs/GDD_TEMPLATE.md](./docs/GDD_TEMPLATE.md) with your game concept
4. Set up the development environment (once technology stack is chosen)

## Documentation

- **[CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md)** - **Quick reference for AI agents** - Start here for concise project overview
- [Project Plan](./PROJECT_PLAN.md) - Overall development roadmap
- [Exploration Concept](./docs/CONCEPT_EXPLORATION.md) - Detailed exploration game concept
- [GDD Template](./docs/GDD_TEMPLATE.md) - Game Design Document template
- [Cast n Chill Analysis](./docs/CAST_N_CHILL_ANALYSIS.md) - Analysis of inspiration game mechanics and design
- [Idle/Casual Design Guide](./docs/IDLE_CASUAL_DESIGN.md) - Design considerations for casual games (note: idle mechanics not included in current version)
- [Concept Brainstorm](./docs/CONCEPT_BRAINSTORM.md) - Brainstorming worksheet
- [Technology Research](./docs/TECHNOLOGY_RESEARCH.md) - Framework comparison and recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Define the core game concept** - What type of game? What's the core mechanic?
2. **Choose technology stack** - Research frameworks (Phaser, PixiJS, Unity, Godot)
3. **Create initial GDD** - Document the vision using the template
4. **Set up project structure** - Initialize with chosen framework

## Questions to Answer

**Current Direction (Defined):**
- ✅ Fantasy Exploration Simulator - Side-scrolling exploration
- ✅ Character: Relatable magical being (wizard or elf)
- ✅ Movement: Walking (side-scrolling), flying may come later
- ✅ World: Handcrafted, small to start (1-2 environments)
- ✅ Art Style: Detailed pixel art
- ✅ Collection: Simple item gathering (no complex menus)
- ✅ Structure: Side-scrolling with set routes
- ✅ Flexible playtime (5 minutes to 5 hours)

**Still Need Clarity:**
- Which specific environments to start with? (Enchanted Forest? Misty Valley? Crystal Cave?)
- What specific items to collect? (Flowers, crystals, artifacts, etc.?)
- What triggers progression/unlocks? (Collection count? Time? Discovery milestones?)
- Timeline expectations? (Weekend project, months, ongoing)
- Monetization? (Free, one-time purchase, freemium)
