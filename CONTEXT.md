# Game Project Context

**Quick reference for AI agents and collaborators**

## Game Concept

**Type:** Fantasy Exploration Simulator - Side-scrolling 2D exploration game  
**Genre:** Casual Exploration / Walking Simulator  
**Platforms:** Web (primary), Mobile & Steam (future via wrappers)

A relaxed, side-scrolling exploration game where players control a relatable magical being (wizard or elf) aimlessly wandering through handcrafted fantasy landscapes. Focus is on beautiful scenery, peaceful discovery, and simple item collection. **No quests, no pressure, just exploration.**

## Key Design Decisions

- **Character:** Relatable human-like being (wizard or elf), not too fantastical
- **Movement:** Walking (side-scrolling, left/right), flying may come as discovery later
- **World:** Handcrafted, 1-2 environments to start, expandable
- **Art Style:** Detailed pixel art - beautiful and polished
- **Collection:** Simple item gathering, no complex menus or nested structures
- **Active Play Only:** Player controls ALL movement - NO idle/automatic wandering

## Game Pillars

1. **Peaceful Exploration** - No pressure, no danger, just wander and discover
2. **Flexible Playtime** - Enjoyable in 5 minutes or 5 hours
3. **Player-Controlled** - Player controls all movement and exploration
4. **Beautiful Pixel Art** - Detailed, polished, atmospheric visuals
5. **Simplicity First** - Simple systems, no complex menus or nested structures
6. **Handcrafted Worlds** - Quality over quantity, start small, expand later
7. **Aimless Discovery** - No quests or objectives, player sets their own pace
