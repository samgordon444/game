## Key Design Elements

### What Makes It "Chill"

2. **Dual Modes** - Active when you want, idle when you don't
3. **Simple Loop** - Cast, catch, sell, upgrade (easy to understand)
4. **Visual Style** - 2D pixel art (relaxed, nostalgic)
5. **Collection Focus** - Long-term goals without pressure

### Core Gameplay Loop
```
1. Cast line (active) OR let game auto-fish (idle)
2. Catch fish
3. Sell fish for currency
4. Use currency to upgrade equipment
5. Access new locations/fish with better gear
6. Repeat with new challenges
```

## What Works Well

1. **Flexibility** - Appeals to both active and idle players
2. **Clear Progression** - Always something to work toward
3. **Collection Appeal** - 50+ fish creates long-term goals
4. **Low Stress** - No pressure, just chill fishing
5. **Social Element** - Fishing with friends adds engagement
6. **Charm** - Dog companion adds personality

## Potential Design Spaces for Differentiation

### What Could Be Different?
1. **Setting/Theme** - Not necessarily fishing? (Gardening? Mining? Crafting?)
2. **Mechanics** - Different core loop? (Trading? Building? Exploration?)
3. **Visual Style** - Pixel art is great, but other styles could work
4. **Progression Systems** - Different upgrade paths? Multiple currencies?
5. **Social Features** - Different multiplayer approach? Or solo-focused?
6. **Collection Depth** - More categories? Variants? Evolution systems?

## Technical Considerations (Inferred)

- **Background Processing** - Idle mode requires efficient background systems
- **Save System** - Must track progress, fish caught, equipment owned
- **Collection Tracking** - 50+ fish requires good data management
- **Multiplayer** - Cooperative features need networking
- **Performance** - Long idle sessions need optimization

## Target Audience

- Casual gamers
- Idle game fans
- Collection/completionist players
