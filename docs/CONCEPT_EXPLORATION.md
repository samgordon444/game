## What Makes It "Chill" & Aimless

**No Objectives:**
- No quests or missions

- Pure exploration
- Player sets their own pace

**No Pressure:**
- No time limits
- No danger or combat
- No failure states
- Just wander and enjoy

**Flexible Engagement:**

## Differentiation from Cast n Chill

**Similar:**

- Fantasy theme
- Walking/wandering focus
- Simpler systems (no complex menus)

## Design Decisions (Answered)

1. **Character:** Relatable human-like (wizard or elf), not too fantastical
2. **Movement:** Walking primarily, flying may come as discovery later
3. **World:** Handcrafted, small to start (1-2 environments), expandable
4. **Art Style:** Detailed pixel art - beautiful and polished
5. **Collection:** Simple item gathering, no deep menus or nested structures
6. **World Structure:** Side-scrolling with set routes for wandering

## MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product:**
- 1 handcrafted side-scrolling environment
- Simple walking controls
- Basic item collection (pick up items along path)
- Simple collection display
- Beautiful pixel art for one environment

**Future Expansion:**
- Additional environments
- More items to discover
- Flying ability/discovery
- Seasonal changes
- More routes within environments

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity First** - No complex menus or systems
2. **Beauty Matters** - Detailed pixel art, atmospheric
3. **Peaceful Exploration** - No pressure, no danger
4. **Player-Controlled** - Player controls all movement and exploration
5. **Start Small** - 1-2 environments, expand later
6. **Handcrafted** - Quality over quantity
